Pokédex App

## My Go PokémonGo! Repository 

This build utilizes JavaScript and Bootstrap integration with data fetched from the PokéAPI to generate a responsive and interactive Pokédex.


## Project Brief

I was responsible for all front-end design and development in this project, from initial HTML code and CSS styling, then subsequent iterations, to DOM manipulations, and JavaScript code with Bootstrap integration. 


## Web Development

Front-end
- HTML5 — Structuring the webpage and content.
- CSS3 & Bootstrap 5.3.8 — Styling and responsive design, including grid and component styles.
- JavaScript (ES6) — All interactivity, data fetching, rendering, and event handling.


## API Data

- PokéAPI — Public RESTful API used for fetching Pokémon data such as names, images, heights, weights, and types.

Tools & Libraries
- AJAX Fetch — To make HTTP requests to PokéAPI for data.
- jQuery 3.7.1 - Initially used for API data retrieval, event handling
- Bootstrap 5.3.8 JS Components (Modal, Navbar, Buttons) — Interactive UI elements.
